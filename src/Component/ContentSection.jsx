          Let us assume an individual, unfortunately, meets with an accident on
          the road. His medical expenses and hospital bills start piling up. Now
          he needs ₹5 Lakh to pay his expensive medical bills. Fortunately, his
          best friend signed up on Masoom Trust crowdfunding platform, completed
          the process of submitting valid documents needed for verification. In
          a few minutes, he created a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for
          his friend’s medical expenses. Now, this campaign can be shared with
          all his near and dear ones through WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter,
          Facebook and E-mail. In a matter of few minutes, funds start coming in
          to support the financial needs of the injured friend.
